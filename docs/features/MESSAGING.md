## Messaging

### Description
The messaging feature in Synapse enables real-time text communication between users. It ensures that messages sent by one user are immediately available to others in the same chat room, providing a seamless and interactive chat experience.

### How It Works

1. **Sending Messages**
   - **Client-Side Interaction**: When a user sends a message, the `chats.tsx` component on the client side handles this action. It captures the message input and sends it to the server using a Socket.IO event.
     - **Socket Event**: `event:message`
       - This event carries the raw message data from the client to the server.

2. **Processing on the Server**
   - **Receiving the Message**: The server receives the raw message data through the `event:message` event. It then processes this message to include any necessary metadata or transformations.
   - **Database Storage**: After processing, the server saves the message to the chat database. This involves inserting the message into the appropriate chat room or conversation based on the room identifier.
     - The server uses database queries to store the message in the chat table.

3. **Relaying Messages**
   - **Broadcasting to Room Members**: Once the message is successfully stored in the database, the server retrieves the original chat document and broadcasts the message to all users in the relevant chat room.
     - **Socket Event**: `user:message`
       - This event is used to emit the processed message to each client in the chat room, ensuring all participants receive the latest messages in real-time.
       - The server uses `socket.to(room).emit()` to send the message to all clients connected to the specific room.

### Key Points
- **Real-Time Communication**: The use of Socket.IO enables instant delivery and receipt of messages, enhancing the chat experience.
- **Database Integration**: Messages are stored in a database for persistence and retrieval, ensuring that chat history is maintained.
- **Broadcast Mechanism**: The server's broadcasting capability ensures that all members of a chat room receive new messages simultaneously.

This explanation covers the core workflow of the messaging feature, detailing how messages are sent from the client, processed and stored on the server, and then relayed to all participants in a chat room.
